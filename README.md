# Field-Alchemical-Kit-
Adds a portable alchemical kit to shops in Daggerfall Unity.


 **What does this mod brings into the game?**

Additional one item (Field Alchemical Kit) allowing to mix potions in the field, outside
of guild services, hopefully allowing for slightly more flexible gameplay for some rather
specific character builds and anybody who is not interested in Temple guilds / Dark Brotherhood /
Archaeologists.

Can be purchased from most alchemical shops. 
           
Requires 0.27 version of the Daggerfall Unity. 


 **Points of Consideration**

1. Field Alchemical Kit is very bulky item (20+ kg.), so player need to possess free space in inventory in order to effectively use this item.

2. Field Alchemical Kit is rather costly item (900+).

3. Field Alchemical Kit have limited uses of potentially mixed potions before item become broken.

These drawbacks been done deliberately in order to not render guild potion mixers useless and preserve game balance.


 **Compatibility**

This mod should have no compatibility issues, as it simply adds new asset into the game.
